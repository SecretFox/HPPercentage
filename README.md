# HPPercentage
Shows targets health percentage on the healthbar  
Use `/option HPP_Mode` chat command to configure mode  
Available modes:  
* 1 - Normal (SWL default)  
* 2 - Percentage Only  
* 3 - Both (Mod Default)  

Use `/option HPP_Decimals` to change amount of decimals (default 0)  


Additionally you can recolor the HPBar with `HPP_OwnColor` and `HPP_HostileColor` commands.  
Format is 0x + hexcode (see https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp)  
e.g:  
`/option HPP_OwnColor 0x20FF8A`  
`/option HPP_HostileColor 0xff4646`  
You can also set them to false to change back to default colors  
For now, color only affects targetinfo and not nametags (overhead floaty things).
